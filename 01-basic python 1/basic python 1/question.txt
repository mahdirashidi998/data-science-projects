The number of birds banded at a series of sampling sites has been counted by your field crew and entered into the following list. The first item in each sublist is an alphanumeric code for the site and the second value is the number of birds banded. Cut and paste the list into your assignment and then answer the following questions by printing them to the screen.
data = [['A1', 28], ['A2', 32], ['A3', 1], ['A4', 0],
        ['A5', 10], ['A6', 22], ['A7', 30], ['A8', 19],
		['B1', 145], ['B2', 27], ['B3', 36], ['B4', 25],
		['B5', 9], ['B6', 38], ['B7', 21], ['B8', 12],
		['C1', 122], ['C2', 87], ['C3', 36], ['C4', 3],
		['D1', 0], ['D2', 5], ['D3', 55], ['D4', 62],
		['D5', 98], ['D6', 32]]
